# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) uses deep learning and reinforcement learning principles to create efficient algorithms applied on areas like robotics, video games, NLP (computer science), computer vision, education, transportation, finance and healthcare. Implementing deep learning architectures (deep neural networks) with reinforcement learning algorithms (Q-learning, actor critic, etc.) is capable of scaling to previously unsolvable problems. That is because DRL is able to learn from raw sensors or image signals as input. A remarkable milestone in DQN is that agent uses end-to-end reinforcement learning with convolutional neural networks for playing ATARI games.
# Open AIGym
OpenAI Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It supports teaching agents everything from walking to playing games like pong or pinball. Gym is an open source interface to reinforcement learning tasks. Gym provides an environment and itâ€™s is up to the developer to implement any reinforcement learning algorithms. Developers can write agent using existing numerical computation library, such as TensorFlow or Theano.
